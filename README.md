The aim of this project is to create a pseudorandom binary sequence (PRBS) --> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_binary_sequence  send this signal as an infrasound wave and afterwards capture it at a maximum of 40km of altitude.

This is part of a series of programs developed for the SPACIS project that hopefully will be launched with the help of the European Space Agency as part of the Swedish-German BEXUS programme (https://rexusbexus.net/). 






BEXUS – Balloon EXperiments for University Students – is an annual stratospheric research balloon programme.
